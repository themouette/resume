    I'm French and I used to have my own business, building an online scheduling app
    for proximity services. It was both a technical and a personal experience: being
    an architect, a manager, a sysadmin, a developer and whatever else it took. I
    started as the only developer, working from home. 2 years later company raised
    some money and we saw our self up to 6. We finally didn't make it to the market.
    Product could be perfected as every app does, but we mostly lacked sales skills.
    I have none and the employee I hired was too junior. High level skills might be
    hard to find when you're running out of money. As contracting to pay employees
    was not my goal, I decided to move forward and am now contracting for myself and
    they all had great opportunities.

    Now that I'm free of responsibility and New Zealand seems to be the hell of a
    place, I would like to come live in Wellington starting in September.
    Full with energy, I really love programming and Web based development is the
    coolest thing around those times, sparkling everywhere.
